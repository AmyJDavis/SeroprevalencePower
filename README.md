Power analysis for seroprevalence studies

Often I am asked to conduct a power analysis for future seroprevalence studies. I have created a (hopefully) user-friendly app for wildlife disease researchers to use to determine the number of animals they will need to sample depending on the type of seroprevalence study they are conducting.  

This respository is for the shiny app that I have created to conduct power analyses.  To run the code the "What is statistical power?" pdf needs to be included in a folder named "www" in the same working directory as the app.R file.  The code should run smoothly from there.
