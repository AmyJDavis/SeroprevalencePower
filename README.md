Power analysis for seroprevalence studies

Often I am asked to conduct a power analysis for future seroprevalence studies. I have created a (hopefully) user-friendly app for wildlife disease researchers to use to determine the number of animals they will need to sample depending on the type of seroprevalence study they are conducting.  

This repository is for a shiny app that I have created to conduct power analyses for seroprevalence studies. To run the code from your computer, download the 'app.R' file and the 'www' folder and its contents to your computer.  These should be saved in the same working directory. The 'www' folder contains a pdf named "What is statistical power?" and a png file named "USDA_bw_transparent". The "What is statistical power" document is a short primer on power that I wrote to help inform the user on what power is and how to interpret the different aspects of the app.  The code should run smoothly from there. 

The app provides guidance on how to use the app from within the app itself. Each section also provides descriptions on how to interpret the results that are presented.
